# Eddie
Eddie is a Telegram bot coded in Python, and uses the awesome [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org) 
library as a base. 

**Note**: Eddie is still in development, and because of this, it may or may not contain bugs. We'll see.

## Installation
Python 3 is required for Eddie to run. Python 3.5.2 or higher is recommended for the best performance. 

**Note regarding Python 3.6 support**: 3.6 will be supported whenever it comes out and whenever the Python-Telegram-Bot 
devs are able to update the codebase to support the massive changes made in 3.6.

### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/KamranMackey/EddieBot.git
cd EddieBot
```

### Install required dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Mark as excutable (Linux-only!)
```
chmod +x EddieBot.py
```

### Run
Run `EddieBot.py` once so that it can generate the `config.ini` file. You will get an "Invalid token" error due to the 
`token` setting being blank, but just ignore it for now. Now, edit `config.ini`, and under the `Basic Settings` section, 
set your token to the one you received from BotFather. You should now be able to run the bot!
